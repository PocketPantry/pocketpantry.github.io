                    The simplicity, usability, and friendliness of Pocket Pantry is all thanks to our
                    CTO, Atinderpaul Kanwar. Atinderpaul has devised long-term plans for Pocket Pantry's future
                    growth.

                    When Ebrahim isn't promoting Pocket Pantry's services or researching marketing strategies,
                    he can be found in the gym pumping iron. Receiving his Bachelor's in Business Administration
                    from Algonquin College, Ebrahim is an asset to our team's continued growth.

                    With a degree in Integrated Media from OCAD University, Joshua has the ability to tell tales through photography,
                    as he does in his position as Graphic Designer.
